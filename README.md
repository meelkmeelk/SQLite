# SQLite

Since my initial choice of using oracle was pretty much destroyed after watching some tutorials on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruaHsLtxld0
ive decided to start with sqlite first, then when I'm used to the framework imma get to oracle again. 

For SDL which was supposedly on Friday 14/4/2023, I spent a day trying to learn Oracle or PL-SQL from the video stated above, could not understand half of whatever he is saying, so I moved on to practice + learn sqlite on: https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite-exercises/sqlite-basic-simple-exercises.php

This repo is to document my progress in sqlite on vscode, idk how to link, i did link it with the vscode with gitbash on my laptop but it seems to clash
